# ODySSEUS: an Origin-Destination Simulator of Shared E-mobility in Urban Scenarios

## Introduction

ODySSEUS is a data management and simulation software for mobility data, focused mostly on shared fleets in urban environments. 

Its goal is to provide a general, easy-to-use framework to simulate shared mobility scenarios across different cities using real-world data.

Internally, it makes use of several open-source Python libraries for geospatial and mobility analysis, such as geopandas (https://geopandas.org/) and scikit-mobility [5].

ODySSEUS is composed by four main functional modules, each one coming with its own API, command line interface and GUI:

* City Data Manager (previously UMAP [4])
   * Upload or collect raw input data from different sources.
   * Provide utilities to normalise data into a common format (e.g. column naming).
   * Provide a unified interface to access and analyse normalised data.

* Demand Modelling
   * Create different demand models using:
      * Poisson/KDE estimation and mobility samples generation [3]
      * Deep Learning to learn and forecast mobility demand [6]
   * Create demand-side simulation scenarios.

* Supply Modelling
   * Create fleets choosing between different modes and vehicles.
   * Create and configure refueling/charging infrastrucures and energy mix for electricity production.
   * Define operator strategies to manage its resources

* Simulator
   * Create and run simulation scenarios based on supply and demand configurations.
   * Collect several performance metrics (satisfied demand, fleet handling cost, equivalent CO2 emissions, gross profit, ...)
