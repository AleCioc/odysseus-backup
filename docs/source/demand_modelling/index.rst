Introduction
-----------------------------

Create different demand models using:

- Standard mathematical models [5] (random walk models, exploration and preferential return model, etc.)
- Migration models [5] (gravity model, radiation model, etc.).
- Data-driven (e.g. Poisson/KDE estimation [3], Deep Learning [6])
- Evaluate the goodness of a demand model under different viewpoints and compare different demand models.
Create demand-side simulation scenarios.
