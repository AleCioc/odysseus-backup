Introduction
-----------------------------

Supply Modelling represents a digital twin for a shared mobility operator who conducts its business
in a given city data scenario with a certain mobility demand.
Managing a shared mobility fleet presents many challenges related to the management of infrastructure, in this case vehicles and service stations, as well as the dynamic and often unpredictable behavior of users
and their mobility demand.

In particular, it is possible to define and control the following aspects:

- Create and configure vehicles.
- Create and configure refueling/charging infrastrucures and energy mix for electricity production.
- Create and configure different policies for fleet and infrastructure management
